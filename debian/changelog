wasta-multidesktop-xenial (0.9.2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * adding wasta-logout.sh: Nautilus will now be set as the default desktop
    manager each logout, since if it isn't then it is difficult to get Unity
    to start correctly.  So Cinnamon users will get Nemo set as their desktop
    manager each login by the wasta-login.sh script.
